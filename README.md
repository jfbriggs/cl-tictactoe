# Command Line Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a basic command-line tic-tac-toe game.

Simply install dependencies with `npm install`, and then run `npm start` from the root folder.

Players alternate turns (one representing 'X', one 'O'), and select space numbers.
Spaces are represented by number values (first row = 1-3, second row = 4-6, third row = 7-9).

The game will check if there's a winner after each turn, and the game ends (application exits) once a player wins or a draw is confirmed.
